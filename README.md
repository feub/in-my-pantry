# Welcome to In My Pantry 👋🍓🫘🧈🍌🌿🍞🍦🍪

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## My first React Native project

This is my first real project in **React Native** with **Expo**. Nothing big here, just a small app that allows me to learn how to develop a cross-platform mobile app with **Expo**.
